    If you want to build a static mc binary, which does not
    use or require any shared libraries, then enable this option.
    This can cause mc to be considerably larger, so you should
    leave this option false unless you have a good reason (i.e.
    your target platform does not support shared libraries, or
    you are building an initrd which doesn't need anything but
    mc, etc).

    Most people will leave this set to 'N'.
